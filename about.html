                <h5>Developer</h5>
                <p>
                    I am a newly graduated full stack developer. I can provide clear code and a good looking design.
                    I am familiar with javascript, html, css, python, jquery.
                    I done project for E-commerce, forums, regular site whit just html and css code.

                <h5>Previous</h5>
                <p>    
                    For the past 15 years, I have previously worked in hotels and restaurants.
                    For the past 6 years, I have been a  head chef in Nordic choice hotels. But have always had an interest in
                    coding websites and learning to build my own. so 1 year ago I made the decision to start my
                    education for my next adventure.
                    During my years as a leader, I have learned to work with different types of people, handle different
                    kinds of challenges and come up with solutions to all sorts of problems.
